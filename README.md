## About the project
The aim of this project is to create a stippled (or dotted) version of an original image, using the Poisson disk sampling based on a density map over a grid.

## How to use the project
The distribution of files is as follows:
 * <ins>arch_grid.py:</ins> contains the implementation of the grid structure used to perform the sampling
 * <ins>main.py:</ins> main file for applying the sampling to a given image, along with some displays

## Example
